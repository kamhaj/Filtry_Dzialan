# Filtry_Dzialan

Application created to **add** and **update** action filters structures (base FTD table and its FTD_Elementy elements; folder data/sql_files; 
files FTD.sql i FTD_Elementy.sql)

## INFO
As for ORM and REST API framework - Django was used. <br />
Dummy json data (for task 2 and task 3) is stored in .json files (it would be received by functions from webapplication frontend) <br />
As for testing framework PyTest was used. To run test simply run pytest command in project's root folder (CMD) <br />
```bash
pytest
```
main.py file used for running db creation (company_database.sqlite3 file, task 1) <br />


## This task was accomplished in 6 steps:
- [x] task 1: <br />
writing a script to create a database based on provided .sql  (FTD structure) and .csv files (tables Program, Os, Dzialanie)  - db from this step is  company_db.sqlite3. It was created using task_1/db_creation_actions_filters_1.py script to automate (to some extent) creating tables from .csv files and later for django's inspectdb tool (to crete database models used in db.sqlite3 file - a database used futher from this point)
- [x] task 2: <br />
    creating a function that gets all rows from Program table in JSON format 
- [x] task 3: <br />
    creating a function that gets all rows from Program table in JSON format
- [x] task 4: <br />
    creating a function that gets all rows from Program table in JSON format
- [x] task 5: <br />
    writing tests to cover basic behaviours of functions from previous steps
- [x] task 6: <br /> 
    creating REST API for functions from previous steps (GET, POST, PUT)


## Where to look for task solutions:
1. Task 1: ./db_creation/process.csv.files.py (CREATE TABLE statements from .csv files) <br />
and db_creation_actions_filters.py (creates company_database.sqlite3 file that is later use for Django 'inspectdb' tool to create db.sqlite3 - base project database)
2. Task 2: ./filtry_dzialan_app/views.py 
3. Task 3: ./filtry_dzialan_app/views.py 
4. Task 4: ./filtry_dzialan_app/views.py 
5. Task 5: ./tests/test_filtry_dzalan_app/ (folder)
6. Task 6: ./filtry_dzialan_app/views.py


## Usage

1. Clone repo
2. Activate virtual environment
3. Install requirements from a file
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
4. Run server locally (from where manage.py file is)
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
5. In a browswer access "http://localhost:8000/action_filters/" to see proper URLs to all app functionalities.
6. Access url 'localhost:8000/action_filters/programs-list/' to list all rows from Program table
(task 2)
7. Access url 'localhost:8000/action_filters/action_filter/' + POST to create an action filters structure to db (task 3). <br /> Provide JSON data.
```json
	{        
	    "id_ftd": 
        {
            "nazwa": "stworz moj nowy filtr dzialan",
            "opis": "moj nowy filtr dzialan"
        },
        "id_dzialanie_list": [4709,6669, 6670, 6671]
	}

```
<br> It creates FTD_ELEMENTY table rows. <br />
<br> id_ftd dictionary contains data to create FTD table element (Foreign Key in FTD_ELEMENTY) <br />
<br> id_dzialanie_list contains DZIALANIE table rows to be assigned (Foreign Keys in FTD_ELEMENTY)<br />

9. Access url 'localhost:8000/action_filters/action_filter/' + PUT to update an existing action filters structure (task 4). <br /> Provide JSON data.
```json
	{        
	    "id_ftd": 
        {
			"id_ftd": 22,
            "nazwa": "filtr dzialan update using rest api",
            "opis": "rest api test"
        },
        "id_dzialanie_list": [6669, 6670]
	}
```
<br> It updates FTD_ELEMENTY table rows. <br />
<br> id_ftd dictionary contains data to update FTD table element (Foreign Key in FTD_ELEMENTY) <br />
<br> id_dzialanie_list contains DZIALANIE table rows to be assigned (Foreign Keys in FTD_ELEMENTY). Any previous rows are unassigned (deleted from FTD_ELEMENTY table)<br />

11. REST API  <br />
12. Running tests



## TODO - IN PROGRESS
1. Develop more unit tests
